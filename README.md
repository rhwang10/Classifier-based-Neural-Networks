# Classifier-based-Neural-Networks

This project involved 3 collaboraters, including myself. Inspired by prior literature on deep forest techniques, we aimed to see if we could implement an efficient classifer, based off of the classical multilayer neural network architecture. This implementation is specifically of a classifier-based neural network, using random forest classifiers in each node. We tested our classifier against standard classifiers in the machine learning realm, including decision trees, random forests, and neural networks and wrote our results in the paper included in this repository.
